Note that all objects reffered to OUTSIDE (not attatched) to the aircraft are inside the A340-600-Models.xml.
This way, everything inside the A340-600.xml could be reffered to through this and given a <Pitch-degree>tag,
so that the entire aircraft could be pitched forward appropraitely on the runway without the whole interior
being moved.
