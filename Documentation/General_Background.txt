This is a model replica of an Airbus A340-600 typical Aircraft, Designed and manufactured in real life by Airbus
Industries, of the European Union country of France. It has four Rolls-Royce Trent 500 Engines.

The Airbus A340-600, made by Airbus Industries, is the longest civil airliner in world. It was was added to
FlightGear by Liam, starting in early November 2009.

Designed as an early generation 747 replacement, the A340-600 caries up to 380 passengers in a three-class
cabin layout (or 419 in a 2-class layout), with a range of over 7,500 nautical miles (13,900 km). It provides
similar passenger capacity to a 747 but with 25% more cargo volume, and at lower trip and seat costs. First
flight of the A340-600 was made on 23 April 2001. Virgin Atlantic began commercial services in August 2002.
The A340-600 is more than 10 m longer than a basic -300, making it the longest airliner currently in production;
more than four metres longer than the Boeing 747-400 and 2.3m longer than the A380. The Airbus A340-600 will
continue to hold the record for being the worlds longest commercial aircraft until the first Boeing 747-8 
Intercontinental is rolled out in 2010.
